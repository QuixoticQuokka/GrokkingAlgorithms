# GrokkingAlgorithms
It's been many years since my last formal algorithms and data structures class. I decided to do a refresher by reading through the book Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava. Trying out examples and jotting down notes here.

Bhargava's code can be found at https://github.com/egonschiele/grokking_algorithms
